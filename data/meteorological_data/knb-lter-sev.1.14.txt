    These data were collected from a network of 10 permanent weather
    stations on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Station 40 has
    been in operation since the middle of 1987; Stations 41-44 were
    installed in the early part of 1989; Station 45 was put into
    operation on 26 Jan 1990 (hour 15); Station 46 was put into
    operation on 31 Aug 1990 (hour 17); and Station 1 was put into test
    operation on 29 Dec 1991 (hr 12) and official data recording started
    on 01 Jan 92 (hr 01). A new station (#48) was established during
    1998 (on Oct 1 1998) at a site designated as Savana (initially
    called Blue Springs. Station 49 was installed in the Five Points
    area in 1999 and named Five Points. Another new station was
    established in 2001 at a new core study site designated as Blue
    Grama and given a station ID number of 50.

    Sampling Design Stations were located across the Sevilleta and
    surrounding areas to cover the entire spatial and elevational extent
    of the refuge. They were also generally located adjacent to other
    pertinent study locations such as plant and animal monitoring
    studies. Measurement Techniques Automated weather stations Each
    weather station includes a 3 m tripod tower, on which is mounted
    most of the monitoring equipment. This equipment includes an
    enclosure housing a datalogger and power supply. On the tripod are
    mounted an anemometer and wind vane, a pyranometer, and a solar
    radiation shield that encloses a combination temperature and
    relative humidity sensor. Other attached sensors include: a
    precipitation gauge, soil temperature sensors and soil moisture
    potential sensors.
