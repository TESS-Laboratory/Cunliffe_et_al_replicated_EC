# Boschetti_et_al_replicated_EC

This repository contains R code for processing, analysing and visualizing the eddy covariance data presented in 'Strong correspondence in evapotranspiration and CO2 fluxes between different EC systems enables quantification of landscape heterogeneity in drylands fluxes.' by Fabio Boschetti*, Andrew Cunliffe*, Robert Clement, Stephen Sitch, Karen Anderson, Tomer Duman, Mikeal Schlumpf, Marcy Litvak, Richard Brazier, Timothy Hill.

## The manuscript is in review

## The processed half hourly EC flux data is archived with the UK Envrionmental Information Data Centre (https://eidc.ac.uk/) and AmeriFlux (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/)

## This repo contains one script
plot_datasets.r
   main script with analysis and visualization of conventional and REC fluxes
