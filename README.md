# Boschetti_et_al_replicated_EC

This repository contains R code for processing, analysing and visualizing the data presented in 'Strong correspondence in evapotranspiration and carbon dioxide fluxes between different eddy covariance systems enables quantification of landscape heterogeneity in dryland fluxes.' by Fabio Boschetti, Andrew Cunliffe, Robert Clement, Stephen Sitch, Karen Anderson, Tomer Duman, Mikeal Schlumpf, Marcy Litvak, Richard Brazier, Timothy Hill. (In Review).

## The manuscript is in review

## The processed half hourly EC flux data is archived with the UK Envrionmental Information Data Centre (https://eidc.ac.uk/) and AmeriFlux (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/). DOI TBC.


## This repo contains one large script
analysis_and_visualization.r
   main script with analysis and visualization of conventional and REC fluxes


## Also a climate script, using data from 
Meteorology Data from the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico (1988- present)
