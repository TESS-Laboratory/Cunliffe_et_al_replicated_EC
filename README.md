# Boschetti_et_al_replicated_EC

This repository contains R code for processing, analysing and visualizing the 
data presented in 'Strong correspondence in evapotranspiration and carbon 
dioxide fluxes between different eddy covariance systems enables quantification 
of landscape heterogeneity in dryland fluxes.' by Fabio Boschetti, Andrew 
Cunliffe, Robert Clement, Stephen Sitch, Karen Anderson, Tomer Duman, Mikeal 
Schlumpf, Marcy Litvak, Richard Brazier, Timothy Hill.

## The manuscript is in review

*The processed half hourly EC flux data is archived with the UK Environmental Information Data Center (https://eidc.ac.uk/) and AmeriFlux (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/). DOI TBC.*


## This repo contains the following scripts
*analysis_and_visualization.r*
Main script with analysis and visualization of half-hourly fluxes from the 
conventional and low-cost systems, including gapfilling time series in 
REdddyProc.

*climate_analysis.R script*
Main script for analysing the climate data (missing PET calculations).
